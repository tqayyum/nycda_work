Goal:

Develop a program that uses Node's fs library to manipulate local files.

Assignment:

I don't know about you but creating a program that can read from one file and write to another sounds pretty cool! Depending on the task, it can also save you a lot of time.

For this assignment, you'll be creating a program that can read from multiple files and writes a new file using that data.

Below are detailed instructions for your program:

Read in a file, named "people1.json", which contains a list of people.
Read in another file, named "people2.json", which contains another list of people.
After both of these files have been read, write a new file called "peopleComplete.txt" which contains a sorted list of all the people from the first two files.
Bonus:

Read in the files from a people directory, and merge all of the files in the directory into a "peopleComplete.json" file
Grading Criteria:

The program reads from both the"people1.json" and"people2.json" files.
The program writes a new file called "peopleComplete.txt" which contains all the people from the first two files.
The list of people in the "peopleComplete.txt" is sorted.
